# joejoe
joejoe is a minor mode for Emacs that seeks to emulate [Joe's Own Editor](https://github.com/jhallen/joe-editor) Wordstar-like keybindings and features. Because Joe does not have some of the same features as Emacs, joejoe also features some new keybindings to make things easier.

The current version of joejoe is incomplete as not all of Joe's features and keybindings have been implemented yet.
