* Joestar
Joestar is a minor mode for emacs that seeks to emulate [[https://github.com/jhallen/joe-editor][Joe's Own Editor]], a wordstar-like terminal text editor. 
* Joestar and undo-tree
Joestar depends on undo-tree, which uses C-x for several of its keybindings, which conflicts with Joestar's usage of C-x.
In order to fix this, Joestar remaps the three following functions:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(define-key map (kbd "s-x u") 'undo-tree-visualize)
(define-key map (kbd "s-x r u") 'undo-tree-save-state-to-register)
(define-key map (kbd "s-x r U") 'undo-tree-restore-state-from-register)

#+END_SRC 
* Tutorial
** A note on Control key sequences
Because of the way that Joe works *C-k C-e* is the same as *C-k e*, whereas Emacs considers those to be different key sequences. In joestar mode, just like in joe, these are the same sequence.
** Help
Type *C-k h* for help.
** Buffer manipulation.
- *C-y*
Kill the entire line.
- *C-j*
Kill the rest of the line from point.
- *ESC-o*
Kill the to the beginning of the line from point.
